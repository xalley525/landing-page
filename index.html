          <p>These little pyramids are four sided dice. Thankfully, other shapes are becoming more common, which is an excellent development. These guys are basically caltrops, and they're incredibly painful to step on.</p>

        <div class="tile">
          <img class="pic" src="img/temp.jpg" alt="six sided dice">
          <p>A six sided die is probably the first thing that comes to mind when anyone mentions dice. Most everyone is familiar with them since these guys are used for so many different things.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tile">
          <img class="pic" src="img/temp.jpg" alt="eight sided dice">
          <p>These are eight sided dice. See how they look like two pyramids stuck together? This makes them easy to identify if you remember that <span title="In shape, anyway. The average roll of 2d4 is actually slightly higher than the average of 1d8."><span class= "fn">two d4s equals one d8!</span></p>

          <img class="pic" src="img/temp.jpg" alt="ten sided dice">
          <p>These odd looking dice have ten sides. Notice how some of them have two digits to a side? That's because these guys come in two flavors: standard and percentile. The double digits denote the 10s place when <span title="Unless it comes up as 00, in which case your guess is as good as mine."><span class= "fn">rolling for a percent</span>.</p>

          <img class="pic" src="img/temp.jpg" alt="twelve sided dice">
          <p>Here we have our twelve sided dice. I don't actually have much to say about them. They're not commonly used in the games I play, and they mostly exist to confuse me when I'm reaching for a d20.</p>

        <div class="tile">
          <img class="pic" src="img/temp.jpg" alt="twenty sided dice">
          <p>Finally, my personal favorite: the twenty sided die. These are the kind of dice I roll most often, so I have more of them than any other type. This comes in very handy when I have a run of bad luck, since I can just swap out my d20 <span title="This doesn't actually do anything, but superstitions about the ire of the dice gods are very common among dice goblins"><span class= "fn">for a new one!</span></p>
